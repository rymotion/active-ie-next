            To build community by creating, cultivating, and promoting health
            and wellness programs with a low financial barrier of entry in the
            Inland Empire. At Active Inland Empire we aim to be able to foster a
            "third place" with local business partners, city governments, and
            supporting community led efforts to make a safer Southern California
            region.
